# BombsAway

Bombs Away is a puzzle game similar to Minesweeper. Using icons on the screen, you will have to deduce the location of bombs. 

This project was developed for Terrible Hacks IV in collaboration with:
- Eric Qiu
- Tuneer Mondal

Due to the tight time constraints the code is extremely inefficient (but hey, it's Terrible Hacks right!?).
