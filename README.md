# BombsAway

Bombs Away is a puzzle game similar to Minesweeper. Using icons on the screen, you will have to deduce the location of bombs. This project was developed for a hackathon, and hasn't been updated since. Currently working on creating a tutorial, cleaning up the code which is just awful right now due to the time constraints of the hackathon, adding more levels, and developing for android!
